# Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
We are going to generate and solve the classic sudoku game using python. More specificly, it uses backtracking algorithms to generate and solve the problem.
